We have added the hibernate-core and entityManager dependency of hibernate.
Then we created the hibernate configuration file, and declared the
	- database instance, dialect, 
	- show sql

We created @Entity classes, @Embeddable class.

Other annotations are:
	- @ElementCollection
	- 

This project contains examples of simple java application where we have saved 
	UserDetails
		- Address

in the same table as Embedded objects.

For more complex object relations go to the hibernate2 project.
