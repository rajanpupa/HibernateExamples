We changed the configuration in the hibernate.cfg.xml 
	- database instance, dialect, 
	- show sql

We created @Entity classes, @Embeddable class.

Other annotations are:
	- @ElementCollection
	- 

This project contains examples of simple java application where we have saved 
	UserDetails
		- list of Address

in the same table as Embedded objects.

For more complex object relations go to the hibernate2 project.
